I had the pleasure to collaborate with [Felipe Basso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-basso-vera-24389296/) to present the talk "DevOps is more than technology" during the first version of [Nerdearla 101](https://101.nerdear.la/es/) (2023) in Santiago of Chile.

During this session we explained that DevOps is more than the tipical practices and technologies that organizations are trying to do and/or implement, it's one of the common pitfalls behind DevOps adoptions that drives to painful failures. To avoid this, we shared 3 keys of success based on our experience working with several organizations, these are:

* **Customer focus**: it's key that all parties involved have a clear vision of service to a customer: internal or external, and how they interact, so that the flow works and cognitive loads are reduced. It also eliminates the view that my job starts here and ends there.
* **Measure, measure, and measure**: to know the current situation, analyze it to identify opportunities for improvement, and demonstrate results, there is nothing better than numbers. DORA metrics are the most widely used in the world.
* **Promote synergy**: it's not just about Dev and Ops, there are other baton passes to deliver value from idea to customer.
