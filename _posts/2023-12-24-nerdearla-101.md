I had the pleasure to collaborate with Felipe Basso to present the talk "DevOps is more than technology" during the first version of Nerdearla 101 in Santiago de Chile.

Take in count it was in spanish because we were in Chile, but feel free to ask us in the comments to have same content in english.
