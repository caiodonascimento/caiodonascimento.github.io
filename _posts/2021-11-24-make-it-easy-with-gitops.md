My first time participating in the event that coined one of the most popular movements in IT world, I'm talking about [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org/) which is partially accountable of DevOps movement. It was a complete pleasure and I encorage all DevOps human to participate.

During this talk I took a technical perspective focused on implementing the engineering practice known as [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) opensource platform.

I hope soon have the chance to publish a guide step-by-step related to this talk.

Unfortunately this session was not recoreded, but you can watch my intro here in [Facebook Video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3312492085644885).
